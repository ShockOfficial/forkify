# Forkify

That's my first more advanced OOP project with MVC architecture.
Project built and coded by me, but it comes from JS course.

## What i learnt
- MVC architecture
- ASYNC JS ( AJAX )
- API calls ( download and upload )
- All theory about Event Loop, Microtask queue, callack queue, call stack and all about js runtime
- Work with localstorage
- How to use modules.
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- OOP in JS in practise
- Code refactoring
- Updating UI only elements that changed ( not whole view )
... and a lot more :)
